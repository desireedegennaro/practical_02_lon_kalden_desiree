Amazon Web Services (AWS)
Leading cloud platform with 200+ services

Global availability through regions, availability zones, and data centers

Pay-as-you-use cost model

Potentially cheaper than traditional data center setups (but not always)

History of AWS
Launched in 2006 with only S3 & EC2

By 2010, expanded to include:

SimpleDB, Elastic Block Store, RDS, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, CloudFront, Availability Zones, etc.

Early adoption was encouraged through competitions with big prizes

Continuous innovation – now 200+ services for ops, dev, analytics, and more

Cloud Models
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
Provides basic IT infrastructure (VMs, storage, networking)

Examples: EC2, EBS, VPC

Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Removes infrastructure management overhead

Focus on application deployment

Examples: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda

Software as a Service (SaaS)
Fully managed software applications

Examples: Google Workspace, Dropbox, Salesforce

AWS Shared Responsibility Model
AWS Responsibilities (Security OF the Cloud)
Physical Security – Protecting data centers, controlling access

Infrastructure Maintenance – Power, HVAC, networking equipment

Virtualization Management – Hypervisors, host OS updates

Managed Services Maintenance – Keeping AWS-managed software updated

Client Responsibilities (Security IN the Cloud)
Data Management – Classification, encryption, sharing policies

Access Control – Proper IAM configuration, enforcing Principle of Least Privilege

Application & OS Management – Self-hosted app security, network security (VPC)

Compliance & Governance – Meeting organizational security requirements

AWS Global Infrastructure
Regions – Geographical areas (e.g., us-east-1, us-west-1)

Availability Zones (AZs) – Multiple isolated data centers within a region

Edge Locations – Used for CDN and caching to improve content delivery
