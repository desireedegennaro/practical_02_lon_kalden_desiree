Amazon Web Services
Leading Cloud Platform with over 200 different services available
Globally available via its massive networks of regions and availability zones with their massive data centers
Based on a pay-as-you-use cost model. 
Theoretically cheaper than renting rackspace/servers in a data center… Theoretically.

History of AWS
Originally launched in 2006 with only 2 services: S3 & EC2. 
By 2010, services had expanded to include  SimpleDB, Elastic Block Store, Relational Database Service, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, Simple Workflow, CloudFront, Availability Zones, and others.
Amazon had competitions with big prizes to spur the adoption of AWS in its early days
They’ve continuously innovated, always introducing new services for ops, dev, analytics, etc… (200+ services now)

AWS Service Categories
4

Cloud Models
IaaS (more) - Infrastructure as a Service
Contains the basic services that are needed to build an IT infrastructure
PaaS (more) - Platform as a Service
Remove the need for having to manage infrastructure
You can get right to deploying your app
SaaS (more) - Software as a Service
Provide full software apps that are run and managed by another party/vendor

The Shared Responsibility Model - AWS
AWS Responsibilities (Security OF the cloud):
Security of physical infrastructure (infra) and network
keep the data centers secure, control access to them
maintain power availability, HVAC, etc. 
monitor and maintain physical networking equipment and global infra/connectivity
Hypervisor & Host OSs
manage the virtualization layer used in AWS compute services
maintaining underlying host OSs for other services
Maintaining managed services
keep infra up to date and functional
maintain server software (patching, etc)
7

The Shared Responsibility Model - Client
Client Responsibilities (Security IN the cloud):
Control of Data/Content
client controls how its data is classified, encrypted, and shared
implement and enforce appropriate data-handling policies
Access Management & IAM
properly configure IAM users, roles, and policies. 
enforce the Principle of Least Privilege
Manage self-hosted Apps and associated OSs
Ensure network security to its VPC
Handle compliance and governance policies and procedures
8

The AWS Global Infrastructure
Regions - distinct geographical areas
us-east-1, us-west 1, etc
Availability Zones (AZs)
each region has multiple AZs
roughly equiv to isolated data centers
Edge Locations
locations for CDN and other types of caching services
allows content to be closer to end user.
