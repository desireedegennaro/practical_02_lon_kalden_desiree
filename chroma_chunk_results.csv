This property ensures that the tree remains relatively balanced, leading to faster search operations compared to an ordinary BST where the height could grow logarithmically over time.\n\nHere are some benefits of using AVL Trees:\n\n1. Maintained Balance: The main advantage of AVL trees is that they always remain approximately balanced, ensuring optimal search efficiency due to the O(log n) complexity of search, insertion, and deletion operations.\n\n2. Efficient Search and Rotations: Since the tree remains balanced, the average height of the tree remains low, resulting in efficient searching. The rotations required for maintaining balance are also fast because they only involve single-node movements (rotations) rather than rearranging entire subtrees like in B+ trees.\n\n3. Space Efficiency: While AVL trees may require additional space to store the balance factor at each node, the overall balance of the tree reduces the number of levels and makes the tree more compact. This can be particularly beneficial when memory usage is a concern.\n\n4. Simple Implementation: Compared to more complex self-balancing trees like Red-Black Trees or Splay Trees, AVL trees have a simple structure and are relatively easy to implement due to their straightforward balancing rule (re-balancing occurs during insertion and deletion operations).' images=None tool_calls=None"

Guaranteed Performance: With a guaranteed height of O(log n), AVL trees offer efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations with average time complexities of O(log n) in the worst case.\n\n3.

Balanced Structure: An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, meaning it maintains its height balanced during insertions, deletions, and searches. This ensures that the number of levels (depth) in the tree does not grow too large, providing efficient performance for search, insert, and delete operations.\n\n2. Maintaining Balance: In an AVL Tree, the balance factor is calculated as the difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees at each node. A rotation may be performed whenever a balance factor becomes +2 or -2 to restore balance. This ensures that no single insertion or deletion can throw the tree off-balance too much.\n\n3. Efficient Operations: Since an AVL Tree maintains its balance, it offers O(log n) time complexity for the basic operations of search (find), insertion, and deletion, making it more efficient than unbalanced binary search trees like simple BSTs or red-black trees in some situations.\n\n4. Ease of Implementation: AVL Trees can be implemented easily because their balance factor ensures that only a limited number of rotations are needed to maintain the tree's balance.

Stable Performance: In contrast to other self-balancing trees like Splay Trees that favor frequent access of recently used nodes, AVL Trees have a more stable performance pattern since they focus on maintaining balance without giving preference to any specific node or operation.
